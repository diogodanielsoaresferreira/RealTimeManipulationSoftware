# Real Time Manipulation Software

Project done during classes of Computer Vision (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017

Application done using Qt and OpenCV, that demonstrates the application of several images processing algorithms to saved videos or to webcam captured videos.

The effects that can be applied to the videos are:
* Red Image
* BLue Image
* Green Image
* Grey Image
* Invert image
* Change Color
* Change brightness and contrast

* Create Segmentation

* Background subtraction using KNN
* Background subtraction using MOG

* Mean blur
* Median blur
* Gaussian blur

* Contrast streching
* Equalize histogram
* Brightness and contrast auto
* Back projection

* Erode
* Dilate
* Opening
* Closing
* Morphological gradient
* Top hat
* Black hat
* Threshold binary
* Threshold binary inverted
* Truncate
* Truncate to zero
* Truncate to zero inverted

* Sobel operator
* Canny detector
* Detect edges with dilate
* Laplace operator
* Find and draw contours

* Harris corner detection
* Shi-tomasi corner detection
